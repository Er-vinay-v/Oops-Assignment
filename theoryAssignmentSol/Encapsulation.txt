1.What is Encapsulation in Java? Why is it called Data hiding?
Ans: The process of binding data and corresponding methods (behavior) together into a single unit is called encapsulation in Java.In other words, encapsulation is a programming technique that binds the class members (variables and methods) together and prevents them from being accessed by other classes, thereby we can keep variables and methods safe from outside interference and misuse.If a field is declared private in the class then it cannot be accessed by anyone outside the class and hides the fields within the class. Therefore, Encapsulation is also called data hiding.


2.What are the important features of Encapsulation?
Ans :  Encapsulation is a key concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves combining data and methods within a single unit known as a class. Here are some important
features of encapsulation i.e-
Data Hiding
Abstraction
Access Control
DataIntegrity


3.What are getter and setter methods in Java Explain with an example?
Ans:Getter and setter methods, also known as accessor and mutator methods, are used in Java to access and modify the private data members of a class, respectively. They provide a layer of abstraction that allows us to control the access to the data and enforce constraints on the data
as needed. Here's an example to illustrate how getter and setter methods work.
public class Demo
{
Int id;
String name;
public void setId(int id){
this.id=id;
}
public void setName(String name){
this.name=name;
}
public int getId(){
return id;
}


public String getName()
{
return name;
}


4.What is the use of this keyword explained with an example?
And:this keyword refers to the current object or instance of a class. It is used to
differentiate between instance variables and parameters or local variables that
have the same name, and to pass the current object as a parameter to other
methods or constructors. Here's an example to illustrate the use of the this
keyword.


public class Person {
private String name;
private int age;
public Person(String name, int age) {
this.name = name;
this.age = age;
}
public void printDetails() {
System.out.println("Name: " + this.name);
System.out.println("Age: " + this.age);
}
public void changeName(String name) {
this.name = name;
}
public void changeAge(int age) {
this.age = age;
}
public void callOtherMethod() {
// Pass the current object as a parameter to another method
otherMethod(this);
}
private void otherMethod(Person p) {
// Do something with the Person object passed as a parameter
}
}


5.What is the advantage of Encapsulation?
Ans: There are the following advantages of encapsulation in Java.
They are as follows:
.The encapsulated code is more flexible and easy to change with new requirements.
. It prevents the other classes from accessing the private fields.
. Encapsulation allows modifying implemented code without breaking other code who have implemented the code.
.It keeps the data and codes safe from external inheritance. Thus,Encapsulation helps to       achieve security.
. It improves the maintainability of the application.




6. How to achieve encapsulation in Java? Give an example.
Ans:Encapsulation is achieved in Java by declaring the instance variables of a class as private, and providing public getter and setter methods to access and modify the values of these variables. This allows us to control access to the data and ensure that it can only be modified
through the methods of the class,rather than directly accessing the instance variables from
outside the class.
Example:
public class EncapsulationExample
{
private String email;
private int password;


public String getEmail(String email ){
this.email=email;
}


Public void setEmail(){
return email;
}


public int getPassword(int password){
this.password=password;
}
public void setPassword(){
return password;




}
